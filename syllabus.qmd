## Course Description
  
This is a graduate-level class in statistical methods on multilevel modeling, a popular technique in behavioral and social science research. The course covers topics in multilevel modeling, including two- and three-level hierarchical linear models (HLM), random intercepts and slopes, longitudinal models and growth curve models, and some recent development in multilevel modeling.

The course begins with a brief overview of the ubiquity of multilevel data and the problems of using conventional methods to handle such data. It then transitions to the conceptual and statistical foundations of two-level multilevel models. Students will learn from different real data examples, and perform analyses using data of their own or provided by the instructor. Later material covers the use of multilevel modeling as a general framework for longitudinal data analysis, and other modeling considerations such as categorical data, non-hierarchical (e.g., cross-classified) data structure, and study designs. Students are also encouraged to provide input in suggesting topics to be covered for this course.

## Learning Objectives
  
After the successful completion of this course, students will be able to . . .

1. Explain the problems of analyzing clustered data with multiple regression/ANOVA;
2. Identify the types of multilevel data structure in different research scenarios;
3. Describe the statistical and conceptual foundations of multilevel modeling;
4. Independently analyze real data using statistical software for multilevel modeling;
5. Evaluate published research that uses multilevel modeling;
6. Apply multilevel modeling in a research project, and effectively communicate findings/products in an oral research presentation or a written research report.

**Prerequisite(s):** PSYC 503: Regression and the General Linear Model (or a similar regression class)

**Co-Requisite(s):** None

**Concurrent Enrollment:** None

**Recommended Preparation:** Experience with statistical software (preferably R)

## Course Notes

This class will be in-person and will follow a [flipped course design](https://cet.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/flipped-course-model.docx). The benefit of a flipped course model is that the lecturer can spend more time with students to go through applications of concepts and hands-on exercises of data analyses. 

The lecture videos and course materials will be available at https://psyc575-2021fall.netlify.app by 9:00 am of each Monday, and students are expected to review these materials and the assigned readings on their own. Please note that the lecture slides only serve to guide class discussions and cannot replace the assigned readings. 

Except for Week 1, the **Tuesday meetings** will be optional **Q&A sessions** where students can bring their questions so that the instructor and the class can discuss unclear concepts. During the **mandatory Thursday meetings**, students will work on quizzes, in-class exercises, and discuss questions regarding the learning materials and homework assignments. **Students are expected to have reviewed the posted materials for that week before attending that week's group exercise session.** 

Before attending the Thursday sessions, students are expected to have 

1. Completed the assigned readings and reviewed the posted videos. 
2. Identified questions that come up in their learning. 
3. Started working on the homework problems. 

## Communication

To promote independence and critical thinking, students are encouraged to work through the following process for obtaining answers to course-related questions before contacting the instructor: 

- consult the course syllabus;
- consult a classmate or post your questions on Slack;
- meet with the instructor during office hours or Q&A sessions on Tuesdays;
- for personal questions, email the instructor at hokchiol@usc.edu

## Technological Proficiency and Hardware/Software Required

- [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) are needed to complete the course assignments. It is highly recommended that students update to the latest versions of both software (R 4.2.1, RStudio 2022.07.1, or above). We will discuss how to set up R and RStudio in Week 1. 
- Stable internet connection (for reviewing lecture videos)

## Description and Assessment of Assignments{#assignments}

1. In-class exercises (10%). During the Thursday sessions, students will participate in group exercises. If students miss a session for any reason, they can complete the exercise posted on Blackboard within 36 hours (i.e., Friday by end of day, Pacific Time) to get credits. 
2. Homework problems (60%). There will be 10 homework assignments for students to apply the concepts and techniques discussed in class to analytic problems. The assignments typically involve performing data analyses using data sets of your own or provided by the instructor, and interpreting the results with some guided questions.  
You must submit your work electronically to Blackboard by **Friday 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time** on the assigned due date. See policy on [late work](#late-work).
1. Final project (30%: 5% prospectus, 5% peer review, 20% presentation/final paper). You will complete a research project related to multilevel modeling, typically a research report of an empirical study using real data or a theoretical/methodological paper about certain aspects of multilevel modeling. Students interested in other project ideas (e.g., software package development) should discuss their ideas with the instructor. Each student can choose to work on their own or in a group of up to three people. Each student/group will schedule an appointment with the instructor to talk about their project during week 9 (October 18--22).

    There are three grading components for your final project:
  
    - Prospectus (5%)  
    A prospectus about your project should be submitted by <span style="color:red">**the day before the individual meeting**</span>. The prospectus should contain a concise description of what you (or your group) plan to do for your project, including a preliminary plan for statistical analysis. The prospectus should be limited to 1 single-spaced page (excluding tables, figures, references, and other supplemental materials).

    - Peer Review (5%)  
    After the individual meeting with the instructor, each individual/group will refine their research questions and post a summary of their research questions and preliminary analyses to the dedicated forum on the Discussion Board by **Friday, November 5**. Each student will then give specific comments to the summaries of two other students/groups by **Monday, November 15**. More information on what feedback to give will be included in the grading rubric.  

    - Final Presentation/Paper (20%)  
        If you choose to do a presentation, on **November 30 or December 2**, you or your group will give a 20-minute presentation (including Q&A) on your project. The final presentation should include the following four sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion; for methodological or theoretical work, students should follow organizations that are typical in previous papers in their areas of research.  **More emphasis should be put on describing the technical details of the analysis and the interpretations of the results**. You will also need to submit your slides to Blackboard for grading **on the day of your presentation**, which should include a link to the reproducible codes for your analyses. A grading rubric on the research presentation will be posted on Blackboard.

        If you choose to do a final paper, your paper will be due **Tuesday, December 9, at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time** (the assigned final exam time for the class). The final paper should include four sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion, or comparable sections; however, **more emphasis should be put on describing the technical details of the analysis and the interpretations of the results**. There should also be a link to the reproducible codes for your analyses. The final paper should be 8-15 double-spaced pages of text (i.e., excluding title page, abstract, references, tables, figures, and appendices).

## Participation

Participation accounts for 10% of the course grade. To earn full credit for participation, students should complete and turn in all in-class exercises.

## Assignment Submission
  
The assignments should be submitted through Blackboard by Friday at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time, before the class starts.

## Grading Timeline
  
Generally, all graded work will be returned no later than one week from the submission deadline. However, given the high number of students in the class, the instructor may only grade selected questions in each assignment. Solutions will be posted so that students can check their own work. 

## Late work
  
Late work will be penalized by a 10% deduction in the assignment grade every 24 hours late unless due to an emergency excused by the instructor. Email the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternate arrangements due to an emergency.

## Technology in the classroom

### Phones

Your phone should be turned off or in silent mode (not on vibrate), and should not be used in the classroom.

### Tablets and Laptops

During lecture time in the classroom, students can use tablets and laptops only for purposes of viewing course materials and taking notes. Use of tablets and laptops for note taking is strongly discouraged as it may distract both yourself and your peers ([Sana, Weston, & Cepeda, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254)). During the in-class exercises, students should use their laptops to complete the assignments.

## Attendance
  
Students are expected to attend all Thursday class sessions on time. If they miss a session, they should complete the class exercises and turn in their work within the timeframe specified in [Description and Assessment of Assignments](#assignments).

## Classroom Norms

From USC's [FALL 2021 GUIDE: Return To Campus Protocols](https://we-are.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-Fall-Guide.pdf) document,

> Students, faculty and staff need to be aware of [COVID-19 symptoms](https://studenthealth.usc.edu/files/2020/08/COVID19-symptoms-768x556.jpg), and are required to complete a daily self-screening via [Trojan Check](https://trojancheck.usc.edu/login#/consent) before coming onto campus or leaving their on-campus residence.

> Students, faculty, and staff are required to wear masks indoors, including classrooms – and no food or drink is permitted during class

The following applies to both in-person and online communications (e.g., Slack discussions and email communications)

- Respect each other's views. 
- In written communication messages, make sure they are something you could say to someone to their face.
- Recognize and/or remember that we have different backgrounds. 
- Criticize ideas, not individuals or groups.
- Either support statements with evidence, or speak from personal experience.

## COVID-19 Guidance

Students should consult the latest COVID-19 testing and health protocol requirements for on-campus courses. Continuously updated requirements can be found on the USC COVID-19 resource center website at https://coronavirus.usc.edu/ and https://we-are.usc.edu/.
