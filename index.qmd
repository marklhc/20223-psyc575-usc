---

This is the course website for PSYC 575 in the 2022 Fall semester. The course follows a flipped course model so that students will review assigned readings and prerecorded lecture videos at their own time, while the class meeting time will be dedicated to software demonstration, Q&A, and exercises. You will find the syllabus, lecture materials, and R codes in the navigation bar at the top.
