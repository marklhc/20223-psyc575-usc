## Load Packages and Import Data

You can use add the `message = FALSE` option to suppress the package loading messages

```{r load-pkg, message = FALSE}
# To install a package, run the following ONCE (and only once on your computer)
# install.packages("psych")
library(psych, include.only = "pairs.panels") # for scatterplot matrix
library(here) # makes reading data more consistent
library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and plotting
library(car) # some useful functions for regression
library(modelsummary) # for making tables
library(sjPlot) # for plotting slopes
library(interactions) # for plotting interactions
```

### Import Data

First, download the data file `salary.txt` from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marklhc/marklai-pages/master/data_files/salary.txt>, and import the data. A robust way to do so is to download the data to a folder called `data_files` under the project directory, and then use the `here` package. This avoids a lot of data import 
issues that I've seen. 

[P.S.]: # (You can hide the output by adding `results = 'hide'`)

```{r salary_dat, results = 'hide'}
# The `here()` function forces the use of the project directory
here("data_files", "salary.txt")
# Read in the data
salary_dat <- read.table(here("data_files", "salary.txt"), header = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, from the menu, click `File` &rightarrow; `Import Dataset` &rightarrow; `From Text (base)...`, and select the file. 

```{r show-salary_dat}
# Show the data
salary_dat
```

You can see the description of the variables here: <https://rdrr.io/cran/MBESS/man/prof.salary.html>

## Quick Scatterplot Matrix

Import to screen your data before any statistical modeling

[P.S.]: # (You can hide the input by adding `echo = FALSE`)

```{r pairs-salary_dat}
pairs.panels(salary_dat[, -1], # not plotting the first column
    ellipses = FALSE
)
```

## 1. Linear Regression of `salary` on `pub`

### Visualize the data

```{r p1-smooth}
# Visualize the data ("gg" stands for grammar of graphics)
p1 <- ggplot(
    salary_dat, # specify data
    # aesthetics: mapping variable to axes)
    aes(x = pub, y = salary)
) +
    # geom: geometric objects, such as points, lines, shapes, etc
    geom_point()
# Add a smoother geom to visualize mean salary as a function of pub
p1 + geom_smooth()
```

A little bit of non-linearity on the plot. Now fit the regression model

### Linear regression

You can type equations (with LaTeX; see a [quick reference](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/amsmath/)). 

P.S. Use `\text{}` to specify variable names

P.S. Pay attention to the subscripts

$$\text{salary}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{pub}_i + e_i$$

- Outcome: `salary`
- Predictor: `pub`
- $\beta_0$: regression intercept
- $\beta_1$: regression slope
- $e$: error

```{r m1}
# left hand side of ~ is outcome; right hand side contains predictors
# salary ~ (beta_0) * 1 + (beta_1) * pub
# remove beta_0 and beta_1 to get the formula
m1 <- lm(salary ~ 1 + pub, data = salary_dat)
# In R, the output is not printed out if it is saved to an object (e.g., m1).
# Summary:
summary(m1)
```

### Visualize fitted regression line:

```{r p1-fitted}
p1 +
    # Non-parametric fit
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
    # Linear regression line (in red)
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red")
```

### Confidence intervals

```{r confint-m1}
# Confidence intervals
confint(m1)
```

### Interpretations

> Based on our model, faculty with one more publication have predicted salary of $350.8, 95% CI [$196.4, $505.2], higher than those with one less publication. 

But what do the confidence intervals and the standard errors mean? To understanding what exactly a regression model is, let's run some simulations.

***

### Simulations

Before you go on, take a look on a [brief introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGvJl8vvlXY) by Clark Caylord on Youtube on simulating data based on a simple linear regression model. 

Based on the analyses, the sample regression line is 
$$\widehat{\text{salary}} = 48439.09 + 350.80 \text{pub}.$$
The numbers are only sample estimates as there are sampling errors. However, if we assume that this line truly describe the relation between `salary` and `pub`, then we can simulate some fake data, which represents what we could have obtained in a different sample. 

Going back to the equation
$$\text{salary}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{pub}_i + e_i,$$
the only thing that changes across different samples, based on the statistical model, is $e_i$. Conceptually, you can think of the error term $e_i$ as **the deviation of person $i$'s salary from the mean salary of everyone in the population who has the same number of publications as person $i$.** Here we assume that $e_i$ is normally distributed, written as $e_i \sim N(0, \sigma)$, where $\sigma$ describes the conditional standard deviation (i.e., the standard deviation across individuals who have the same number of publications). From the regression results, $\sigma$ is estimated as the `Residual standard error` = 8,440. 

Based on these model assumptions, we can imagine a large population, say with 10,000 people

```{r fake-pop}
# Simulating a large population. The code in this chunk
# is not essential for conceptual understanding
Npop <- 10000
beta0 <- 48439.09
beta1 <- 350.80
sigma <- 8440
# Simulate population data
simulated_population <- tibble(
    # Simulate population pub
    pub = local({
        dens <- density(c(-salary_dat$pub, salary_dat$pub),
            bw = "SJ",
            n = 1024
        )
        dens_x <- c(0, dens$x[dens$x > 0])
        dens_y <- c(0, dens$y[dens$x > 0])
        round(
            approx(
                cumsum(dens_y) / sum(dens_y),
                dens_x,
                runif(Npop)
            )$y
        )
    }),
    # Simulate error
    e = rnorm(Npop, mean = 0, sd = sigma)
)
# Compute salary variable
simulated_population$salary <-
    beta0 + beta1 * simulated_population$pub + simulated_population$e
# Plot
p_pop <- ggplot(
    data = simulated_population,
    aes(x = pub, y = salary)
) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
    # Add population regression line in blue
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
p_pop
```

Now, we can simulate some fake (but plausible) samples. An important thing to remember is we want to **simulate data that have the same size as the original sample**, because we're comparing to other plausible samples with equal size. In R there is a handy `simulate()` function to do that. 

```{r sim-data1}
simulated_salary <- simulate(m1)
# Add simulated salary to the original data
# Note: the simulated variable is called `sim_1`
sim_data1 <- bind_cols(salary_dat, simulated_salary)
# Show the first six rows
head(sim_data1)
# Plot the data (add on to the population)
p_pop +
    geom_point(
        data = sim_data1,
        aes(x = pub, y = sim_1),
        col = "red"
    ) +
    # Add sample regression line
    geom_smooth(
        data = sim_data1,
        aes(x = pub, y = sim_1),
        method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "red"
    )
```

```{r alternative-sim-data1, eval=FALSE}
# To be more transparent, here's what the simulate() function essentially is
# doing
sample_size <- nrow(salary_dat)
sim_data1 <- tibble(
    pub = salary_dat$pub,
    # simulate error
    e = rnorm(sample_size, mean = 0, sd = sigma)
)
# Compute new salary data
sim_data1$sim_1 <- beta0 + beta1 * sim_data1$pub + sim_data1$e
```

As you can see, the sample regression line in red is different from the blue line. 

#### Drawing 100 samples

Let's draw more samples

```{r sim-100-samples, results = FALSE}
num_samples <- 100
simulated_salary100 <- simulate(m1, nsim = num_samples)
# Form a giant data set with 100 samples
sim_data100 <- bind_cols(salary_dat, simulated_salary100) %>%
    pivot_longer(sim_1:sim_100,
        names_prefix = "sim_",
        names_to = "sim",
        values_to = "simulated_salary"
    )
# Plot by samples
p_sim100 <- ggplot(
    sim_data100,
    aes(x = pub, y = simulated_salary, group = sim)
) +
    geom_point(col = "red", alpha = 0.1) +
    geom_smooth(col = "red", se = FALSE, method = "lm")
# Code for generating GIF
# # Use gganimate (this takes some time to render)
# library(gganimate)
# p_sim100 + transition_states(sim) +
#     ggtitle("Simulation {frame} of {nframes}")
# anim_save("sim-100-samples.gif")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = file.exists("sim-100-samples.gif")}
knitr::include_graphics("sim-100-samples.gif")
```

We can show the regression lines for all 100 samples

```{r plot-sim_data100}
ggplot(
    sim_data100,
    aes(x = pub, y = simulated_salary, group = sim)
) +
    stat_smooth(
        geom = "line",
        col = "red",
        se = FALSE,
        method = "lm",
        alpha = 0.4
    )
```

The confidence intervals of the intercept and the slope how much uncertainty there is. 

### $p$ values

Now, we can also understand the $p$ value for the regression slope of `pub` is. Remember that the $p$ value is the probability that, if the regression slope of `pub` is zero (i.e., no association), how likely/unlikely would we get the sample slope (i.e., 350.80) in our data. So now we'll repeat the simulation, but without `pub` as a predictor (i.e., assuming $\beta_1 = 0$). 

```{r sim-null}
num_samples <- 100
m0 <- lm(salary ~ 1, data = salary_dat) # null model
simulated_salary100_null <- simulate(m0, nsim = num_samples)
# Form a giant data set with 100 samples
sim_null100 <- bind_cols(salary_dat, simulated_salary100_null) %>%
    pivot_longer(sim_1:sim_100,
        names_prefix = "sim_",
        names_to = "sim",
        values_to = "simulated_salary"
    )
# Show the null slopes
ggplot(
    data = salary_dat,
    aes(x = pub, y = salary)
) +
    stat_smooth(
        data = sim_null100,
        aes(x = pub, y = simulated_salary, group = sim),
        geom = "line",
        col = "darkgrey",
        se = FALSE,
        method = "lm"
    ) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red", se = FALSE) +
    geom_point()
```

So you can see the sample slope is larger than what you would expect to see if the true slope is zero. So the $p$ value is very small, and the result is statistically significant (at, say, .05 level). 

***

### Centering

So that the intercept refers to a more meaningful value. It's a major issue in multilevel modeling. 

$$\text{salary}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{pub}^c_i + e_i$$

```{r m1c}
# Using pipe operator
salary_dat <- salary_dat %>%
    mutate(pub_c = pub - mean(pub))
# Equivalent to:
# salary_dat <- mutate(salary_dat,
#                      pub_c = pub - mean(pub))
m1c <- lm(salary ~ pub_c, data = salary_dat)
summary(m1c)
```

The only change is the intercept coefficient

```{r p1-center}
p1 +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
    # Intercept without centering
    geom_vline(aes(col = "Not centered", xintercept = 0)) +
    # Intercept with centering
    geom_vline(aes(col = "Centered", xintercept = mean(salary_dat$pub))) +
    labs(col = "")
```

## 2. Categorical Predictor 

Recode `sex` as `factor` variable in R (which allows R to automatically do dummy coding). This should be done in general for categorical predictors. 

```{r recode-sex}
salary_dat <- salary_dat %>%
    mutate(sex = factor(sex,
        levels = c(0, 1),
        labels = c("male", "female")
    ))
```

$$\text{salary}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{sex}_i + e_i$$

```{r p2}
(p2 <- ggplot(salary_dat, aes(x = sex, y = salary)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.1)) # move the points to left/right a bit
```

```{r m2}
m2 <- lm(salary ~ sex, data = salary_dat)
summary(m2)
```

The `(Intercept)` coefficient is for the '0' category, i.e., predicted salary for males; the `female` coefficient is the difference between males and females.

Predicted female salary = 56515 + (-3902) = 52613.

### Equivalence to the $t$-test

When assuming homogeneity of variance

```{r t-test}
t.test(salary ~ sex, data = salary_dat, var.equal = TRUE)
```

## 3. Multiple Predictors (Multiple Regression)

Now add one more predictor, `time`
$$\text{salary}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{pub}^c_i + \beta_2 \text{time}_i + e_i$$

```{r p3}
ggplot(salary_dat, aes(x = time, y = salary)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth()
```

```{r m3}
m3 <- lm(salary ~ pub_c + time, data = salary_dat)
summary(m3) # summary
confint(m3) # confidence interval
```

The regression coefficients are the *partial* effects. 

![](https://github.com/marklhc/marklai-pages/raw/master/static/img/regression_venn.png)

### Plotting

The `sjPlot::plot_model()` function is handy

```{r plot-m3}
sjPlot::plot_model(m3,
    type = "pred", show.data = TRUE,
    title = "" # remove title
)
```

### Interpretations

> Faculty who have worked *longer* tended to have *more* publications
> **For faculty who graduate around the same time**, a difference of 1 publication is associated with an estimated difference in salary of \$133.0, 95\% CI [\$-52.6, \$318.6], which was not significant. 

### Diagnostics

```{r m3-diagnostics}
car::mmps(m3) # marginal model plots for linearity assumptions
```

The red line is the implied association based on the model, whereas the blue line is a non-parametric smoother not based on the model. If the two lines show big discrepancies (especially if in the middle), it may suggest the linearity assumptions in the model does not hold.

### Effect size

```{r r2}
# Extract the R^2 number (it's sometimes tricky to
# figure out whether R stores the numbers you need)
summary(m3)$r.squared
# Adjusted R^2
summary(m3)$adj.r.squared
```

Proportion of predicted variance: $R^2$ = `r round(summary(m3)$r.squared, 2) * 100`%, adj. $R^2$ = `r round(summary(m3)$adj.r.squared, 2) * 100`%. 

## 4. Interaction

For interpretation purposes, it's recommended to center the predictors (at least the continuous ones)

$$\text{salary}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{pub}^c_i + \beta_2 \text{time}^c_i + \beta_3 (\text{pub}^c_i)(\text{time}^c_i) + e_i$$

```{r m4}
salary_dat <- salary_dat %>%
    mutate(time_c = time - mean(time))
# Fit the model with interactions:
m4 <- lm(salary ~ pub_c * time_c, data = salary_dat)
summary(m4) # summary
```

### Interaction Plots

Interpreting interaction effects is hard. Therefore, 

> Always plot the interaction to understand the dynamics

#### Using `interactions::interact_plot()`

```{r interaction-plot}
interactions::interact_plot(m4,
    pred = "pub_c",
    modx = "time_c",
    # Insert specific values to plot the slopes.
    # Pay attention that `time_c` has been centered
    modx.values = c(1, 7, 15) - 6.79,
    modx.labels = c(1, 7, 15),
    plot.points = TRUE,
    x.label = "Number of publications (mean-centered)",
    y.label = "Salary",
    legend.main = "Time since Ph.D."
)
```

#### Using `sjPlot::plot_model(..., type = "pred")`

```{r sjPlot-interaction}
plot_model(m4, type = "pred",
           # terms = c(focal_var,
           #           moderator [levels])
           terms = c("pub_c", "time_c [-5.79, 0.21, 8.21]"),
           axis.title = c("Number of publications (mean-centered)", "Salary"),
           # "\n" indicates a line break
           legend.title = "Time since Ph.D.\n (mean-centered)",
           # suppress title
           title = "",
           show.data = TRUE)
```

Another approach is to plug in numbers to the equation:
$$\widehat{\text{salary}} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \text{pub}^c + \hat \beta_2 \text{time}^c + \hat \beta_3 (\text{pub}^c)(\text{time}^c)$$
For example, consider people who've graduated for seven years, i.e., `time` = 7. First, be careful that in the model we have `time_c`, and `time` = 7 corresponds to `time_c` = `r 7 - mean(salary_dat$time)` years. So if we plug that into the equation, 
$$\widehat{\text{salary}} |_{\text{time} = 7} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \text{pub}^c + \hat \beta_2 (0.21) + \hat \beta_3 (\text{pub}^c)(0.21)$$
Combining terms with pub^c^, 
$$\widehat{\text{salary}} |_{\text{time} = 7} = [\hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_2 (0.21)] + [\hat \beta_1 + \hat \beta_3 (0.21)] (\text{pub}^c)$$
Now plug in the numbers for $\hat \beta_0$, $\hat \beta_1$, $\hat \beta_2$, $\hat \beta_3$, 

```{r int-slope-7}
# beta0 + beta2 * 0.21
54238.08 + 964.17 * 0.21
# beta1 + beta3 * 0.21
104.72 + 15.07 * 0.21
```

resulting in 
$$\widehat{\text{salary}} |_{\text{time} = 7} = 54440.6 + 107.9 (\text{pub}^c), $$
which is the regression line for `time` = 7. Note, however, when an interaction is present, the regression slope will be different with a different value of `time`. So remember that

> An interaction means that the regression slope of a predictor depends on another predictor. 

We will further explore this in the class exercise this week. 

## 5. Tabulate the Regression Results

```{r tab-m1-m4}
msummary(list(
    "M1" = m1,
    "M2" = m2,
    "M3" = m3,
    "M3 + Interaction" = m4
),
fmt = "%.1f" # keep one digit
)
```

## Bonus: Matrix Form of Regression

The regression model can be represented more succintly in matrix form:
$$\mathbf y = \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta + \mathbf e,$$
where $\mathbf y$ is a column vector (which can be considered a $N \times 1$ matrix). For example, for our data

```{r head-y}
head(salary_dat)
```

So
$$\mathbf y = \begin{bmatrix}
            51,876 \\
            54,511 \\
            53,425 \\
            \vdots
          \end{bmatrix}$$
$\mathbf X$ is the predictor matrix (sometimes also called the design matrix), where the first column is the constant 1, and each subsequent column represent a predictor. You can see this in R

```{r predictor-matrix}
head(
    model.matrix(m3)
)
```

The coefficient $\boldsymbol \beta$ is a vector, with elements $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots$. The least square estimation method is used to find estimates of $\beta$ that minimizes the sum of squared differences between $\mathbf y$ and $\mathbf X \hat{\boldsymbol \beta}$, which can be written as
$$(\mathbf y - \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta)^\top(\mathbf y - \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta).$$
The above means that: for each value observation, subtract the predicted value of $y$ from the observed $y$ (i.e., $y_i - \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \ldots$), then squared the value ($[y_i - \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \ldots]^2$), then sum these squared values across observations. Or sometimes you'll see it written as
$$\lVert\mathbf y - \mathbf X \boldsymbol \beta\rVert^2$$
It can be shown that the least square estimates can be obtained as
$$(\mathbf X^\top \mathbf X)^{-1} \mathbf X^\top \mathbf y$$
You can do the matrix form in R:

```{r lm-matrix}
y <- salary_dat$salary
X <- model.matrix(m3)
# beta = (X'X)^{-1} X'y
# solve() is matrix inverse; t(X) is the transpose of X; use `%*%` for matrix multiplication
(betahat <- solve(t(X) %*% X, t(X) %*% y)) # same as the coefficients in m3
# Sum of squared residual
sum((y - X %*% betahat)^2)
# Root mean squared residual (Residual standard error)
sqrt(sum((y - X %*% betahat)^2) / 59) # same as in R
```

## Bonus: More Options in Formatting Tables

Here's some code you can explore to make the table output from `msummary()` to look more lik APA style (with an example here: <https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-tables#regression>). However, for this course I don't recommend spending too much time on tailoring the tables; something clear and readable will be good enough. 

```{r tab-tailored}
# Show confidence intervals and p values
msummary(
    list(
        "Estimate" = m4,
        "95% CI" = m4,
        "p" = m4
    ),
    estimate = c("estimate", "[{conf.low}, {conf.high}]", "p.value"),
    statistic = NULL,
    # suppress gof indices (e.g., R^2)
    gof_omit = ".*",
    # Rename the model terms ("current name" = "new name")
    coef_rename = c(
        "(Intercept)" = "Intercept",
        "pub_c" = "Number of publications",
        "time_c" = "Time since PhD",
        "pub_c:time_c" = "Publications x Time"
    )
)
```
