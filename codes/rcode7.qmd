There have been some updates to the R code since the videos were recorded. The major changes are:

1. The code now uses the packaged `simr::powerCurve()` function, instead of the functions I previously made, to obtain power estimates across different levels of sample sizes

2. For some of the examples, I started with a bigger number of clusters and cluster size, which may give more stable results for continuous predictors.
