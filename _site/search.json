Therefore,\n\nAlways plot the interaction to understand the dynamics\n\n\ninteractions::interact_plot(m4,\n    pred = \"pub_c\",\n    modx = \"time_c\",\n    # Insert specific values to plot the slopes.\n    # Pay attention that `time_c` has been centered\n    modx.values = c(1, 7, 15) - 6.79,\n    modx.labels = c(1, 7, 15),\n    plot.points = TRUE,\n    x.label = \"Number of publications (mean-centered)\",\n    y.label = \"Salary\",\n    legend.main = \"Time since Ph.D.\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach is to plug in numbers to the equation:\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{salary}} = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\text{pub}^c + \\hat \\beta_2 \\text{time}^c + \\hat \\beta_3 (\\text{pub}^c)(\\text{time}^c)\\]\nFor example, consider people who’ve graduated for seven years, i.e., time = 7. First, be careful that in the model we have time_c, and time = 7 corresponds to time_c = 0.2096774 years. So if we plug that into the equation,\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{salary}} |_{\\text{time} = 7} = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\text{pub}^c + \\hat \\beta_2 (0.21) + \\hat \\beta_3 (\\text{pub}^c)(0.21)\\]\nCombining terms with pubc,\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{salary}} |_{\\text{time} = 7} = [\\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_2 (0.21)] + [\\hat \\beta_1 + \\hat \\beta_3 (0.21)] (\\text{pub}^c)\\]\nNow plug in the numbers for \\(\\hat \\beta_0\\), \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\), \\(\\hat \\beta_2\\), \\(\\hat \\beta_3\\),\n\n# beta0 + beta2 * 0.21\n54238.08 + 964.17 * 0.21\n\n># [1] 54440.56\n\n# beta1 + beta3 * 0.21\n104.72 + 15.07 * 0.21\n\n># [1] 107.8847\n\n\nresulting in\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{salary}} |_{\\text{time} = 7} = 54440.6 + 107.9 (\\text{pub}^c), \\]\nwhich is the regression line for time = 7. Note, however, when an interaction is present, the regression slope will be different with a different value of time. So remember that\n\nAn interaction means that the regression slope of a predictor depends on another predictor.\n\nWe will further explore this in the class exercise this week."

    "text": "Bonus: Matrix Form of Regression\nThe regression model can be represented more succintly in matrix form:\n\\[\\mathbf y = \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\mathbf e,\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf y\\) is a column vector (which can be considered a \\(N \\times 1\\) matrix). For example, for our data\n\nhead(salary_dat)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSo\n\\[\\mathbf y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n            51,876 \\\\\n            54,511 \\\\\n            53,425 \\\\\n            \\vdots\n          \\end{bmatrix}\\] \\(\\mathbf X\\) is the predictor matrix (sometimes also called the design matrix), where the first column is the constant 1, and each subsequent column represent a predictor. You can see this in R\n\nhead(\n    model.matrix(m3)\n)\n\n>#   (Intercept)       pub_c time\n># 1           1  -0.1774194    3\n># 2           1 -15.1774194    6\n># 3           1 -16.1774194    3\n># 4           1  -1.1774194    8\n># 5           1  -7.1774194    9\n># 6           1 -12.1774194    6\n\n\nThe coefficient \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) is a vector, with elements \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots\\). The least square estimation method is used to find estimates of \\(\\beta\\) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between \\(\\mathbf y\\) and \\(\\mathbf X \\hat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}\\), which can be written as\n\\[(\\mathbf y - \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta)^\\top(\\mathbf y - \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta).\\]\nThe above means that: for each value observation, subtract the predicted value of \\(y\\) from the observed \\(y\\) (i.e., \\(y_i - \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\ldots\\)), then squared the value (\\([y_i - \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\ldots]^2\\)), then sum these squared values across observations. Or sometimes you’ll see it written as\n\\[\\lVert\\mathbf y - \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta\\rVert^2\\]\nIt can be shown that the least square estimates can be obtained as\n\\[(\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X)^{-1} \\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf y\\]\nYou can do the matrix form in R:\n\ny <- salary_dat$salary\nX <- model.matrix(m3)\n# beta = (X'X)^{-1} X'y\n# solve() is matrix inverse; t(X) is the transpose of X; use `%*%` for matrix multiplication\n(betahat <- solve(t(X) %*% X, t(X) %*% y)) # same as the coefficients in m3\n\n>#                   [,1]\n># (Intercept) 47373.3792\n># pub_c         132.9984\n># time         1096.0273\n\n# Sum of squared residual\nsum((y - X %*% betahat)^2)\n\n># [1] 3500978295\n\n# Root mean squared residual (Residual standard error)\nsqrt(sum((y - X %*% betahat)^2) / 59) # same as in R\n\n># [1] 7703.156"

The course covers topics in multilevel modeling, including two- and three-level hierarchical linear models (HLM), random intercepts and slopes, longitudinal models and growth curve models, and some recent development in multilevel modeling.\nThe course begins with a brief overview of the ubiquity of multilevel data and the problems of using conventional methods to handle such data. It then transitions to the conceptual and statistical foundations of two-level multilevel models. Students will learn from different real data examples, and perform analyses using data of their own or provided by the instructor. Later material covers the use of multilevel modeling as a general framework for longitudinal data analysis, and other modeling considerations such as categorical data, non-hierarchical (e.g., cross-classified) data structure, and study designs. Students are also encouraged to provide input in suggesting topics to be covered for this course."

    "text": "Description and Assessment of Assignments\n\nIn-class exercises (12%). During the Thursday sessions, students will participate in group exercises. If students miss a session for any reason, they can complete the exercise posted on Blackboard within 36 hours (i.e., Friday by end of day, Pacific Time) to get credits.\nHomework problems (60%). There will be 10 homework assignments for students to apply the concepts and techniques discussed in class to analytic problems. The assignments typically involve performing data analyses using data sets of your own or provided by the instructor, and interpreting the results with some guided questions.\nYou must submit your work electronically to Blackboard by the assigned due date. See policy on late work.\nFinal project (28%: 5% prospectus, 3% peer review, 20% presentation/final paper). You will complete a research project related to multilevel modeling, typically a research report of an empirical study using real data or a theoretical/methodological paper about certain aspects of multilevel modeling. Students interested in other project ideas (e.g., software package development) should discuss their ideas with the instructor. Each student can choose to work on their own or in a group of up to three people. Each student/group will schedule an appointment with the instructor to talk about their project during weeks 9 and 10 (October 17–28).\nThere are three grading components for your final project:\n\nProspectus (5%)\nA prospectus about your project should be submitted by Monday, October 17. The prospectus should contain a concise description of what you (or your group) plan to do for your project, including a preliminary plan for statistical analysis. The prospectus should be limited to 1 single-spaced page (excluding tables, figures, references, and other supplemental materials).\nPeer Review (3%)\nAfter the individual meeting with the instructor, each individual/group will refine their research questions and post a summary of their research questions and preliminary analyses by Friday, November 4. Each student will then give specific comments to the analyses of other students/groups by Monday, November 14. More information on what feedback to give will be included in the grading rubric.\nFinal Presentation/Paper (20%)\nIf you choose to do a final paper, your paper will be due Tuesday, December 13, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (the assigned final exam time for the class). The final paper should include four sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion, or comparable sections; however, more emphasis should be put on describing the technical details of the analysis and the interpretations of the results. There should also be a link to the reproducible codes for your analyses. The final paper should be 8-15 double-spaced pages of text (i.e., excluding the title page, abstract, references, tables, figures, and appendices)."

    "text": "Course-specific Policies\n\nAssignment Submission\nThe assignments should be submitted through Blackboard by Fridays. If needed, students can submit the homework before Sunday at 5:00 pm, without any penalty.\n\n\nGrading Timeline\nGenerally, all graded work will be returned no later than one week from the submission deadline. However, given the high number of students in the class, the instructor may only grade selected questions in each assignment. Solutions will be posted so that students can check their work.\n\n\nLate work\nLate work will be penalized by a 10% deduction in the assignment grade every 24 hours late unless due to an emergency excused by the instructor. Email the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternate arrangements due to an emergency.\n\n\nTechnology in the classroom\n\nPhones\nYour phone should be turned off or in silent mode (not on vibrate), and should not be used in the classroom.\n\n\nTablets and Laptops\nDuring lecture time in the classroom, students can use tablets and laptops only for purposes of viewing course materials and taking notes. During the in-class exercises, students should use their laptops to complete the assignments.\n\n\n\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to attend all Thursday class sessions on time. If they miss a session, they should complete the class exercises and turn in their work within the timeframe specified in Description and Assessment of Assignments.\n\n\nClassroom Norms\nFrom USC’s COVID-19 safety and other key reminders on August 2,\n\nMonitor your symptoms before coming to campus. If you experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19, stay home and do not go to class, work or any other location. Arrange to be tested for COVID-19.\n\n\nWe strongly recommend wearing medical-grade masks or respirator masks (including surgical, N95, KN95, KF94) when indoors around others to reduce transmission and risk of infection.\n\nThe following applies to both in-person and online communications (e.g., Slack discussions and email communications)\n\nRespect each other’s views.\nIn written communication messages, make sure they are something you could say to someone to their face.\nRecognize and/or remember that we have different backgrounds. \nCriticize ideas, not individuals or groups.\nEither support statements with evidence, or speak from personal experience.\n\n\n\nCourse Evaluation\nStudent feedback is essential for the instructor and the Department to keep improving this course. Students are encouraged to share their feedback and suggestions in an early-term feedback survey around week 4 to 5, and respond to the standard USC course evaluation survey at the end of the semester."

Please familiarize yourself with the discussion of plagiarism in SCampus in Part B, Section 11, “Behavior Violating University Standards” policy.usc.edu/scampus-part-b. Other forms of academic dishonesty are equally unacceptable. See additional information in SCampus and university policies on Research and Scholarship Misconduct.\n\n\nStudents and Disability Accommodations:\nUSC welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs. The Office of Student Accessibility Services (OSAS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter disability-related barriers. Once a student has completed the OSAS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and accommodations are determined to be reasonable and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be available to generate for each course. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive.
